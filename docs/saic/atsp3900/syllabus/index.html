<div class="md-block"><p><strong><em>Professional Practice: Web Art</em></strong> is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development, and explores the history and culture of the web. As a Professional Practice course, this class will foreground strategies for communicating our artistic/creative backgrounds to the public through a personal artist website, as well as actively discuss what it means to be an artist/designer/creative person in 2023.</p>
<p>Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is now more than thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring, as well CSS and (optionally) JavaScript to build dynamic websites. The course will combine the goals of a Professional Practices course with those of a Web Art Studio class by centering the class around building a personal portfolio website.</p>

<h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>

<h3>Grading Breakdown</h3>


 
<div class="md-block"><p>Each assignment will have guidelines that make it clear how to receive credit for that assignment. All assignments are credit/no credit.</p>
<p><strong>In order to receive credit for this course, you must complete the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Personal Reflection 1: 25 Questions</li>
<li>Personal Reflection 2: Relationship to your work</li>
<li>Personal Reflection 3: Documentation Practices</li>
<li>Artist Publicity Presentation</li>
<li>Personal Portfolio Website</li>
<li>Attend all 3 one-on-one professional practices meetings</li>
</ol>
</div>



<h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
<p>This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>






<h3>Grading Key</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(cr) credit received = you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.</li>
  
</ul>



<h2> AI-Assisted Content Generation Tools Policy</h2>

<h3> Personal reflection written assignments</h3>

<p>Using text-generating tools like ChatGPT is *strictly prohibited* for the personal reflection writing assignments. These assignments are designed *for you* to work through the prompts. These are personal reflections, after all. ChatGPT can’t possibly know what’s going on inside your head, can it?</p>

<h3>Code assistance / “Professional” written documents</h3>

<p>For everything else, you’re free to use ChatGPT or image generating AI tools as you see fit. Some assignments (like writing our artist statements) will incorporate ChatGPT as part of the assignment. You are *encouraged* to use ChatGPT to help you with your code. We will discuss how to use it effectively in class.</p>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

  
<p>Students are expected to attend all classes regularly and arrive on time. Full participation is required in all aspects of a course—including in-person sessions, synchronous online classes, and  independent  study.</p>
  
<p>Instructors may permit students up to two absences per semester—inclusive of absences due to illness and/or family/personal emergencies.

<div class="md-block"><h2>SAIC Attendance and Participation Policy</h2>
<p>
  Students are expected to attend all classes regularly and arrive on time. Full
  participation is required in all aspects of a course—including in-person
  sessions, synchronous online classes, and independent study.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors may permit students up to two absences per semester—inclusive of
  absences due to illness and/or family/personal emergencies. If a student
  registers late during the add/drop period, they are responsible for catching
  up on all missed content and assignments; instructors may count those missed
  classes as absences.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors have the discretion to define expectations around student
  tardiness, including policies related to late arrivals, mid-class breaks, and
  early departures. These expectations should be clearly outlined in the course
  syllabus and communicated to students during the first class to ensure
  transparency and consistency.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors grant credit only to students who meet the standards and
  expectations of the course.
</p>
<p>
  Students who are ill and unable to attend class should notify their
  instructor(s) by email or leave a message with the department office on the
  day they are absent. For extended absences due to illness, the student should
  contact Health Services, who will notify instructors. For other extenuating
  circumstances, students should reach out to the Academic Advising office.
  Please note that the written notification does not excuse a student from
  classes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Federal Financial Aid Attendance Requirement:</strong> Recipients of
  federal aid must have begun attendance in classes for which their eligibility
  is based upon at the time of disbursement and, in the case of Federal Direct
  Loans (Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and PLUS), be enrolled at least half-time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Religious Holiday Observance:</strong> SAIC recognizes the diverse
  religious and cultural practices of our community. Students are expected to
  notify their instructors early in the semester to discuss reasonable
  accommodations for holidays they observe.
</p>
<h2>Class Progress Reports (CPRs)</h2>
<p>
  Progress Reports are an important tool in SAIC's academic support for
  students. The primary purpose of a Progress Report is to initiate further
  dialogue between the student and faculty member regarding concerns about a
  student's progress in their course. Instructors should submit CPRs through
  Navigate. Progress Report instructions and FAQ can be found
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/navigate">here</a>. The secondary
  purpose of Progress Reports is to make Academic Advising aware of faculty
  concerns: Academic Advisors review Progress Reports and reach out
  appropriately to students when a message (or combination of messages)
  indicates concern.
</p>
<p>
  Class Progress Reports (CPRs) are used to communicate between faculty,
  students, and academic advisors to give feedback on class performance. You may
  receive a CPR if you have missed class, or missed an assignment, critique,
  etc. These communications are intended to help you understand what you need to
  do to stay on track or get back on track and succeed in this class.
</p>
<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is fully committed to complying with all laws ensuring equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities are encouraged to contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. During this appointment, DLRC
  staff will review the student’s documentation and work collaboratively to
  determine reasonable accommodations.
</p>
<p>
  Once accommodations are approved, the DLRC will email a letter outlining the
  accommodations to both the student and their instructors. Students should be
  aware that not all approved accommodations will be applicable to every course.
  It is recommended that students speak with each instructor to discuss how
  their accommodations may be applied in the context of each class before they
  are implemented. To ensure timely support, students should contact the DLRC as
  early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can be reached via phone at
  <span class="contact">312.499.4278</span> or email at
  <a href="mailto:dlrc@saic.edu">dlrc@saic.edu</a>.
</p>
<h3>Student Responsibility in the use of Accommodations</h3>
<p>
  Students approved for accommodations through the DLRC are responsible for
  communicating with their instructors regarding the use and application of
  those accommodations. The implementation of accommodations requires an
  interactive process between the student and the instructor to determine how
  accommodations might be applied in the context of each specific course.
  Because course content, assignments, and learning objectives vary,
  accommodations must be considered on a course-by-course basis to ensure that
  they are both appropriate and do not compromise essential learning outcomes,
  which students are still expected to meet.
</p>
<p>
  Accommodations do not excuse students from the standard requirements of
  communication and attendance. If a student needs to miss class or modify
  participation due to an approved accommodation, they must communicate with the
  instructor in advance whenever possible. In situations where advance notice is
  not feasible, students must notify the instructor within 24 hours of the
  missed class or academic activity. Failure on the student’s part to
  communicate in a timely manner may result in the inability to apply the
  accommodation for that specific instance.
</p>
<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,

  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/student-handbook">SAIC Student Handbook</a>
  (p.12)
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of:
  the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance
  (as defined by individual instructors and laid out in the course syllabus) on
  a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class
  without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to
  properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct also
  includes the falsification of academic or student-related records, such as
  transcripts, evaluations, and letters of recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.
</p>
<h2>Support Resources for Students</h2>
<p>
  The Office of Students Affairs is here to help students achieve success in and
  outside of the classroom and studios. Staff members are available to assist
  students with a wide-range of issues and concerns, including mental and
  physical health concerns, food and housing insecurity, conflicts with others,

  emergency concerns.
