        </div>


<div class="md-block"><p><strong><em>Professional Practice: Web Art</em></strong> is a course that combines creative and practical knowledge related to web site development, and explores the history and culture of the web. As a Professional Practice course, this class will foreground strategies for communicating our artistic/creative backgrounds to the public through a personal artist website, as well as actively discuss what it means to be an artist/designer/creative person in 2023.</p>
<p>Launched in 1989 as a remote file sharing system for scientists, the World Wide Web is now more than thirty years old. Today, the web functions as an exhibition space, a communications hub as well as a nexus for creative expression. Students in the Web Art class will learn the Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), which is the basis of WWW authoring, as well CSS and (optionally) JavaScript to build dynamic websites. The course will combine the goals of a Professional Practices course with those of a Web Art Studio class by centering the class around building a personal portfolio website.</p>
</div>

<h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>

<h3>Grading Breakdown</h3>


 
<div class="md-block"><p>Each assignment will have guidelines that make it clear how to receive credit for that assignment. All assignments are credit/no credit.</p>
<p><strong>In order to receive credit for this course, you must complete the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Personal Reflection 1: 25 Questions</li>
<li>Personal Reflection 2: Relationship to your work</li>
<li>Personal Reflection 3: Documentation Practices</li>
<li>Artist Publicity Presentation</li>
<li>Personal Portfolio Website</li>
<li>Attend all 3 one-on-one professional practices meetings</li>
</ol>
</div>



<h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
<p>This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 6 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>






<h3>Grading Key</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(cr) credit received = you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.</li>
  
</ul>



<h2> AI-Assisted Content Generation Tools Policy</h2>

<h3> Personal reflection written assignments</h3>

<p>Using text-generating tools like ChatGPT is *strictly prohibited* for the personal reflection writing assignments. These assignments are designed *for you* to work through the prompts. These are personal reflections, after all. ChatGPT can’t possibly know what’s going on inside your head, can it?</p>

<h3>Code assistance / “Professional” written documents</h3>

<p>For everything else, you’re free to use ChatGPT or image generating AI tools as you see fit. Some assignments (like writing our artist statements) will incorporate ChatGPT as part of the assignment. You are *encouraged* to use ChatGPT to help you with your code. We will discuss how to use it effectively in class.</p>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

  
<p>Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness (see below), all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses, including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular, independent work and study.</p>
  
<p>Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only if they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course overall.</p>
  
<p>More that 3 unexcused absences will result in a No Credit for the course, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade of W.</p>
  
<p>Two late arrivals will count as a missed section.  I will take attendance promptly at 6:45pm. If you arrive after that, you will be marked late.</p>
  


 
<div class="md-block"><h2>Class Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
  change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will be
  announced during class time when changes occur.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not
  acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied
  to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning
  as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
</p>
<h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.

<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>
<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>
<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>
<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

<h2>Digital Device Policy</h2>
<p>
  The student use of various digital devices in In-Person classes, such as
  laptops, phones, tablets, etc. should be limited only to appropriate use given
  the format of the class. Use of digital devices in class to do non-class
  related work will not be allowed or tolerated.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, use of digital devices in class during screenings will not be
  allowed or tolerated. If a student has a software or hardware related problem
  please visit the CRIT Helpdesk on the 9th floor of the 112 S. Michigan
  (Maclean) Building for assistance addressing these issues.
