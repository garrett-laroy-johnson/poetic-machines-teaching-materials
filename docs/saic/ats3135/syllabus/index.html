  <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
  <p>This studio course investigates the creative possibilities in programming, from interactivity to information visualization. Students explore interactive narratives and games, software art, simulations and emergent behaviors, and other code-based forms. Lectures and demonstrations provide a conceptual, aesthetic and technical foundation in programming as a creative practice. Techniques and concepts are presented through the open-source programming environment p5*js, with an introduction to advanced topics such as server facilitated interactivity and computer vision.</p>
  
  <p>What is at the intersection of art and technology? What does technology help us understand about art? How does art deepen our understanding of technology? Is all art technological? These questions undergird art and technology practices and studies. This course deals with simulation and games, with networked play and interactive art -- these genres of work point out a key affordance of creative media practices, its worldbuilding power.</p>
  
  <p>In this course, we&#39;ll begin to approach these generative problems by beginning to develop our technical facility and expressivity with a creative coding tool. We will get started with a refresher of &quot;beginner&quot; p5*js before continuing to build out an extended toolkit for creating interactive and generative artworks. Your guide here will be the textbook Getting Started with p5*js (see PDF included in materials). You’ll work in a small group to develop a tutorial on two key concept/techniques in p5. After a few weeks, we&#39;ll bring it all together in a teach-in.</p>
  
  <p>We will look at some artistic examples of visualization as well as its sensory sisters sonification and haptic display. After learning how to integrate live data streams via APIs into our sketches, your first project will be display visually (or otherwise) the remaining carbon budgeted before a global increase in temperature of 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius. We&#39;ll read the introduction to McKenzie Wark&#39;s Molecular Red, in particular her emphasis of the concept of the &quot;Carbon Liberation Front&quot;. The CLF generates a view of the anthropocene and the climate crisis that radically decenters our own perspectives. How can visualization and art practice make an analogous move?</p>
  
  <p>In Unit 2 we&#39;ll dive into advanced functionality for keeping track of position, direction, speed, acceleration -- the groundwork of a physics engine -- through the p5.Vector. This will allow us to build towards creating simulations of complex group activity (think of a flock of birds, or a table with a thousand marbles). We will use the Nature of Code text by Daniel Schiffman (PDF also in materials) to walk us through the code, and Baudrillard and Ian Cheng to think through simulation as a world-building technique, which you&#39;ll sum up in your second project.</p>
  
  <p>Unit 3 brings things online. We&#39;ll look at the library p5.Party which will allow us to write code that shares data over a common server, networked interaction. This means you can code interactions between two or more computers -- whether they&#39;re in the same building or across the world. We&#39;ll show some other techniques in computer vision here using a library called MediaPipe that will allow for camera-based sensing of movement. This approach to sensing activity proffers a more deeply embodied interaction scheme that greatly exceeds the complexity of keyboard or mouse interactions which we know from every day. In your project, you&#39;ll put that together with two or more computers with our p5.party library.</p>
  
  <p>This &quot;multiplayer&quot; interaction segues elegantly into our last unit, games. Our approach to games will be heavily in debt to the concept of play and the immersion of role-play. Table-top roleplaying games offer a technical basis for thinking through the structurations and narrativizations in games and play. We&#39;ll leverage that simplicity in this unit, since we may also wish to combine other techniques from the preceding units in our project 4.</p>

  <h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>
  
  <h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
  <p>This class is a 3-hour credit course. During an average week, you will be expected to spend 3 hours on homework per class. Homework will primarily consist of assignment completions, project development, project documentation, and written assignments. See the SAIC Contact / Credit hour policy for a detailed explanation for how homework time is calculated on a per-credit-hour basis.</p>

  <h3>Grading Key</h3>

  *NOTE - Merely turning in all assignments is not a guarantee of receiving
  credit. 
  <h3>Grading by Assignment</h3>
  <ul class="list-group">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Coding Sketches (8) These eight assignments will build your technical skills. They are assigned in weeks when we are not prepping for projects.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Projects (3) These three projects give you the opportunity to bring your artistic practice together with the technical skills you&#39;ve developed.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Group Presentation (1) In small groups, you&#39;ll prepare readings,</li>

  <ul>
    
  </ul>
  <h2>Class schedule</h2>
  <p>
    This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
    change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will
    be announced during class time when changes occur.
  </p>
  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
  </p>
  <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
  <p>
    During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls;
    view or send texts, direct messages, or e-mails; use the internet for any
    purpose unrelated to the course content. You may be asked to leave the
    classroom if you do. “Mental absence” due to cell phone, web surfing, or
    social media distractions will be counted as missed class time (ie, an
    absence), and will contribute to the lowering of your grade.
  </p>
  <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
  
  
<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.
</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

</p>

<h2>Basic Health and Safety Information</h2>
<h5>Face Masks</h5>
<p>
  Individuals may continue to wear masks, though they will no longer be required
  in any on-campus space except at the Wellness Center.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to wear a mask, a tight-fitting surgical mask, N95, or KN95 will
  offer the best protection. Such masks provide good protection even when those
  around you are unmasked.
</p>
<h5>Symptoms and Reporting</h5>
<p>
  If you are ill, even if you’re vaccinated and/or have mild, cold-like
  symptoms, stay home. Continue to report a positive COVID-19 test or COVID-like
  symptoms to SAIC's Case Management Team. If you test positive for COVID-19,
  are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, or show signs or
  symptoms (even if they are mild, cold-like symptoms and you are fully
  vaccinated), please email SAIC’s Case Management Team at
  saic.covid.report@saic.edu.
</p>
<h5>Quarantine and Isolation</h5>
<p>
  A close contact is someone who was within six feet of a positive case for 15
  or more cumulative minutes over the course of a day starting from two days
  before the person began feeling sick or tested positive until the time they
  were isolated. SAIC no longer requires close contacts to quarantine,
  regardless of their vaccination status.
</p>
<p>
  Close contacts are required to promptly contact the Case Management Team and
  follow all instructions. These instructions will include, but are not limited
  to, testing and wearing a surgical mask, N95, or KN95 whenever they are on
  campus, except resident students in their own room. Surgical masks are
  available at security desks upon request.
</p>
<p>
  Individuals who test positive must immediately contact the Case Management
  Team and follow all instructions. They may not come to campus until cleared to
  do so by the Case Management Team.
</p>
