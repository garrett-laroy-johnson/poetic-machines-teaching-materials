<div class="md-block"><h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>In this seminar, we take the programmatic text “We are All Very Anxious” by The
Institute for Precarious Consciousness (2014) as a touchstone. Taking up their
injunction that we need to build “machines for fighting anxiety”, students will
situate their art practice to pursue a research question intervening between the
social and the psychic, the ecological and the cultural. Through a blend of
seminar discussion, research, workshop, tutorial, we will examine and engage
contemporary techniques that help us to ask what anxiety is in 2024, what it
does, and most importantly, what it could do. Students should be prepared to
exercise their metier towards new ends. Broken into thirds, the course pairs
traditions of theorizing anxiety with techniques that appropriate the
conditioning of aesthetic experience towards the production of subjectivity.</p>
<p>We explore the psychoanalytic anxiety of Freud and Lacan as well as the mental
ecosophy of Felix Guattari through works of theory-fiction or hyperstition —-
quasi-archeological texts that generate worlds through bifurcation, paradox, and
supposition. Second, Critical making, creating “objects to think with” that
enact critiques and help us reorient to our problems, allows for a unique
approach to the psychopolitical moblizations of anxiety as theorized by Byung
Chul Han and Renata Salecl. Finally, we approach a materialist reading of
anxiety as found in Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of technology through works of
speculative design.</p>
<p>In 3 tutorial/workshops, students will be invited to extend
their practice through computational media techniques, including a generative
text in HTML, generative risographic duplication, and a generative zine.</p>
</div>

<h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
 
<div class="md-block"><ul>
<li>Motivate an arts-research perspective which intertwines theoretical analysis and proposition with practice-based speculation and world-making</li>
<li>Create a feedback loop between the social, political, and psychological accounts of anxiety and art-making practice</li>
<li>Develop familiarity and facility in thinking both contemporary and 20th century on topics of subjectivity, psyche, unconscious and anxiety.</li>
<li>Update accounts of new media in light of media philosophical accounts of mind and information</li>
<li>Leave with confidence in using theory in discussion of art practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>

<h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
<p></p>



<h3>Grading Key</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(cr) credit received = you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.</li>
  
</ul>





<h2>SAIC Attendance and Participation Policy</h2>
<p>
  Students are expected to attend all classes regularly and arrive on time. Full
  participation is required in all aspects of a course—including in-person
  sessions, synchronous online classes, and independent study.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors may permit students up to two absences per semester—inclusive of
  absences due to illness and/or family/personal emergencies. If a student
  registers late during the add/drop period, they are responsible for catching
  up on all missed content and assignments; instructors may count those missed
  classes as absences.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors have the discretion to define expectations around student
  tardiness, including policies related to late arrivals, mid-class breaks, and
  early departures. These expectations should be clearly outlined in the course
  syllabus and communicated to students during the first class to ensure
  transparency and consistency.
</p>
<p>
  Instructors grant credit only to students who meet the standards and
  expectations of the course.
</p>
<p>
  Students who are ill and unable to attend class should notify their
  instructor(s) by email or leave a message with the department office on the
  day they are absent. For extended absences due to illness, the student should
  contact Health Services, who will notify instructors. For other extenuating
  circumstances, students should reach out to the Academic Advising office.
  Please note that the written notification does not excuse a student from
  classes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Federal Financial Aid Attendance Requirement:</strong> Recipients of
  federal aid must have begun attendance in classes for which their eligibility
  is based upon at the time of disbursement and, in the case of Federal Direct
  Loans (Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and PLUS), be enrolled at least half-time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Religious Holiday Observance:</strong> SAIC recognizes the diverse
  religious and cultural practices of our community. Students are expected to
  notify their instructors early in the semester to discuss reasonable
  accommodations for holidays they observe.
</p>

<h2>Class Progress Reports (CPRs)</h2>
<p>
  Progress Reports are an important tool in SAIC's academic support for
  students. The primary purpose of a Progress Report is to initiate further
  dialogue between the student and faculty member regarding concerns about a
  student's progress in their course. Instructors should submit CPRs through
  Navigate. Progress Report instructions and FAQ can be found
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/navigate">here</a>. The secondary
  purpose of Progress Reports is to make Academic Advising aware of faculty
  concerns: Academic Advisors review Progress Reports and reach out
  appropriately to students when a message (or combination of messages)
  indicates concern.
</p>
<p>
  Class Progress Reports (CPRs) are used to communicate between faculty,
  students, and academic advisors to give feedback on class performance. You may
  receive a CPR if you have missed class, or missed an assignment, critique,
  etc. These communications are intended to help you understand what you need to
  do to stay on track or get back on track and succeed in this class.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h2>
<p>
  SAIC is fully committed to complying with all laws ensuring equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities are encouraged to contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. During this appointment, DLRC
  staff will review the student’s documentation and work collaboratively to
  determine reasonable accommodations.
</p>
<p>
  Once accommodations are approved, the DLRC will email a letter outlining the
  accommodations to both the student and their instructors. Students should be
  aware that not all approved accommodations will be applicable to every course.
  It is recommended that students speak with each instructor to discuss how
  their accommodations may be applied in the context of each class before they
  are implemented. To ensure timely support, students should contact the DLRC as
  early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can be reached via phone at
  <span class="contact">312.499.4278</span> or email at
  <a href="mailto:dlrc@saic.edu">dlrc@saic.edu</a>.
</p>

<h3>Student Responsibility in the use of Accommodations</h3>
<p>
  Students approved for accommodations through the DLRC are responsible for
  communicating with their instructors regarding the use and application of
  those accommodations. The implementation of accommodations requires an
  interactive process between the student and the instructor to determine how
  accommodations might be applied in the context of each specific course.
  Because course content, assignments, and learning objectives vary,
  accommodations must be considered on a course-by-course basis to ensure that
  they are both appropriate and do not compromise essential learning outcomes,
  which students are still expected to meet.
</p>
<p>
  Accommodations do not excuse students from the standard requirements of
  communication and attendance. If a student needs to miss class or modify
  participation due to an approved accommodation, they must communicate with the
  instructor in advance whenever possible. In situations where advance notice is
  not feasible, students must notify the instructor within 24 hours of the
  missed class or academic activity. Failure on the student’s part to
  communicate in a timely manner may result in the inability to apply the
  accommodation for that specific instance.
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Writing Center Hours (CST):</strong> Monday – Thursday: 9:15 AM - 7:15
  PM and Friday: 9:15 AM - 5:15 PM
</p>
<p>
  Though drop-ins are welcome, the best way to guarantee an appointment is to
  schedule one via Navigate:
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/writing-center"
    >https://www.saic.edu/academics/writing-center</a

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/student-handbook">SAIC Student Handbook</a>
  (p.12)
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of:
  the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance
  (as defined by individual instructors and laid out in the course syllabus) on
  a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class
  without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to
  properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct also
  includes the falsification of academic or student-related records, such as
  transcripts, evaluations, and letters of recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.
</p>

<h2>Support Resources for Students</h2>
<p>
  The Office of Students Affairs is here to help students achieve success in and
  outside of the classroom and studios. Staff members are available to assist
  students with a wide-range of issues and concerns, including mental and
  physical health concerns, food and housing insecurity, conflicts with others,
