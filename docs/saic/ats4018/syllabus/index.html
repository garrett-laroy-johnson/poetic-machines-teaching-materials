<div class="md-block"><h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>In this seminar, we take the programmatic text “We are All Very Anxious” by The
Institute for Precarious Consciousness (2014) as a touchstone. Taking up their
injunction that we need to build “machines for fighting anxiety”, students will
situate their art practice to pursue a research question intervening between the
social and the psychic, the ecological and the cultural. Through a blend of
seminar discussion, research, workshop, tutorial, we will examine and engage
contemporary techniques that help us to ask what anxiety is in 2024, what it
does, and most importantly, what it could do. Students should be prepared to
exercise their metier towards new ends. Broken into thirds, the course pairs
traditions of theorizing anxiety with techniques that appropriate the
conditioning of aesthetic experience towards the production of subjectivity.</p>
<p>We explore the psychoanalytic anxiety of Freud and Lacan as well as the mental
ecosophy of Felix Guattari through works of theory-fiction or hyperstition —-
quasi-archeological texts that generate worlds through bifurcation, paradox, and
supposition. Second, Critical making, creating “objects to think with” that
enact critiques and help us reorient to our problems, allows for a unique
approach to the psychopolitical moblizations of anxiety as theorized by Byung
Chul Han and Renata Salecl. Finally, we approach a materialist reading of
anxiety as found in Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of technology through works of
speculative design.</p>
<p>In 3 tutorial/workshops, students will be invited to extend
their practice through computational media techniques, including a generative
text in HTML, generative risographic duplication, and a generative zine.</p>
</div>

<h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
 
<div class="md-block"><ul>
<li>Motivate an arts-research perspective which intertwines theoretical analysis and proposition with practice-based speculation and world-making</li>
<li>Create a feedback loop between the social, political, and psychological accounts of anxiety and art-making practice</li>
<li>Develop familiarity and facility in thinking both contemporary and 20th century on topics of subjectivity, psyche, unconscious and anxiety.</li>
<li>Update accounts of new media in light of media philosophical accounts of mind and information</li>
<li>Leave with confidence in using theory in discussion of art practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>

<h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
<p></p>



<h3>Grading Key</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(cr) credit received = you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.</li>
  
</ul>





<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>
  Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be
  present for the full duration of each class. In class time is for instruction.
  When possible, instructors will make time for students to work independently
  on projects. Unless special permission is granted by the instructor, students
  are required to remain in class during this independent work time.
  Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class so it is
  important that you arrive on time. Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class
  early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your instructors
  if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from
  arriving on time or from participating fully. Be prepared to present a
  doctor’s note if an absence is due to illness.
</p>

<h2>Class Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
  change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will be
  announced during class time when changes occur.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not
  acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied
  to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning
  as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
</p>

<h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>

<p>SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities
for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities,
such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition
who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first
contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual
appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with
you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you and your
instructors with a letter outlining the approved accommodations via email. You
must request accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be
implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible.
The DLRC can be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.</p>

h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>
<p>
  The full SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy can be found in
  the
  <a href="https://www.saic.edu/sites/default/files/Student%20Handbook.pdf"
    >2022/2023 Student Handbook</a
  >, on page 76. All students and faculty should review and be familiar with
  this important policy, as well as how it will be applied in this particular
  course.
</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!
