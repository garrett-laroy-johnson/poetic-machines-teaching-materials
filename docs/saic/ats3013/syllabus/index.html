<div class="md-block"><p>Sound and media art works at the edge of ecology. In fact, many artist and theorists are interested in how media and sound themselves are part of ecology.</p>
<p>In this studio class, students will learn to program the nascent microcomputer Daisy. We will program Daisy ourselves using a patcher style visual programming language called Gen~ built inside of the sound program MaxMSP. Connecting potentiometers and LEDs we will work to create synthesizers for performances we design in response to natural and built environments. With compact microphones, light sensors, and speakers, we will create responsive media systems that form feedback loops with the surrounding ecology.</p>
<p>Our studio practice will be enriched by readings and critiques of important artists working in this field, such as David Dunn, Hildegard von Westerkamp, Lauren Sarah Hayes, Francisco Lopez, among others.</p>
<p>The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student critiques.</p>
</div>

<h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
 
<div class="md-block"><ul>
<li>Develop beginner familiarity with sound synthesis concepts</li>
<li>Create custom configurations of software and hardware that respond artfully to a given site</li>
<li>Critically examine sound and acoustics' role in the built and natural environment</li>
<li>Develop idiosyncratic processes to facilitate creatively engaging with computation</li>
<li>Produce a series of works from exercises to longer-term projects.</li>
<li>Productively discuss and critique peers’ work.</li>
<li>Connect technical skills to critical thinking to create meaningful artistic compositions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GRADING, ATTENDANCE, PRIVACY, AND ACCOMODATION POLICIES</h2>

<h3>Contact / Credit Hour Policies</h3>
<p></p>



<h3>Grading Key</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(cr) credit received = you have completed all projects, coding sketches, and relevant group projects. Your assignments reflect your own learning of the assigned readings that week, while also demonstrating the growth of your own expressive style. You have missed a maximum of two unexcused absences.</li>
  
  <li class="list-group-item">(ncr) no credit received = you have not completed all projects, coding sketches, or relevant group projects. Or, you may have completed these, but not reflected your own learning or growth in the process. Or, you have more than two unexcused absences.</li>
  
</ul>





<h2>Class Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This syllabus is only a general guideline for the course. The schedule will
  change depending on class performance during the semester. Adjustments will be
  announced during class time when changes occur.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not
  acceptable because of the fact that in-class activities are often closely tied
  to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning
  as well as the learning community of the class as a whole.
</p>

<h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>

<p>
  SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal
  opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected
  disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental
  health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or
  accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource
  Center (DLRC) to schedule a virtual appointment. DLRC staff will review your
  disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable
  accommodations. They will then provide you and your instructors with a letter
  outlining the approved accommodations via email. You must request
  accommodations for each course before any accommodations will be implemented.
  You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC can
  be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.
</p>

<h2>SAIC Engagement, Participation, and Attendance Policy Excerpt</h2>

<p>
  Each SAIC course, whether held online or in-person, or a hybrid of both, is a
  learning community that relies on regular, active engagement from all
  participants. Other than in-person activities which are missed due to illness,
  all students are expected to fully participate in each of their courses,
  including in-person classes, synchronous online sessions, and regular,
  independent work and study.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, faculty will give credit to students enrolled in a course only in
  they have responded adequately to the standards and requirements of the course
  overall.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>
  From the SAIC Student Handbook: “Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism
  and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as
  one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the
  same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all
  instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other
  sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or
  student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of
  recommendation.
</p>
<p>
  Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite
  locations and online education.
</p>
<p>
  Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning.
  It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the
  person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP
  authentication, to verify student identity.”
</p>

<h2>Writing Center</h2>
<p>
  Tutors are available in person and online to help students achieve their
  writing goals at any stage of their writing process. All students are welcome,
  and they can work on essays, artist statements, application materials,
  presentation texts, theses, proposals, creative writing, or social media
  posts. The Writing Center tutors are kind, encouraging, and interested!

<h2>Digital Device Policy</h2>
<p>
  The student use of various digital devices in In-Person classes, such as
  laptops, phones, tablets, etc. should be limited only to appropriate use given
  the format of the class. Use of digital devices in class to do non-class
  related work will not be allowed or tolerated.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, use of digital devices in class during screenings will not be
  allowed or tolerated. If a student has a software or hardware related problem
  please visit the CRIT Helpdesk on the 9th floor of the 112 S. Michigan
  (Maclean) Building for assistance addressing these issues.
