<p>The easiest way to get started building electronic circuits is by using a solderless breadboard. A breadboard is a tool for holding the components of your circuit, and connecting them together. It’s got holes that are the right size for hookup wires and the ends of most components, so you can push wires and components in and pull them out without much trouble. This lab shows how to set up a breadboard, both with an Arduino and with an independent power supply (9-12V) through a 5V Voltage Regulator (7805). By the time you finish the lab, you should have an understanding of how the holes in a solderless breadboard are connected, and how to configure your breadboard for different microcontroller projects, and even for projects without a microcontroller.</p>



<p>You won&#8217;t always need a voltage regulator. For most microcontroller circuits, you&#8217;ll get power from your computer&#8217;s USB port, regulated through your microcontroller, to power sensors and LEDs. But for higher current projects or higher voltage projects involving components like motors or larger light sources, it&#8217;s good to know what a voltage regulator is and how to use it.</p>

<p>Figure 10 shows a typical breadboard with a 7805 5-Volt voltage regulator mounted on it. There are several rows of holes for components. The holes on the breadboard are separated by 0.1-inch spaces, and are organized in many short rows in the center, and in two long rows down each side of the board. The short horizontal rows in the middle are separated by a center divider. The pattern varies from model to model; some breadboards have only one strip down each side, others have multiple side rows, and some have no side rows at all.</p>



<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vimeo.com/374067285#t=0m38s" target="_blank">Related Video: Introduction to breadboards</a></p>



<p>On each side of the board are two long rows of holes, with a black&nbsp;or a red line next to each row (on many boards, you&#8217;ll see a blue row instead of black). &nbsp;All the holes in each of these lines are connected together with a strip of metal in the back. In the center are several short rows of holes separated by a central divider. All of the five holes in each row in the center are connected with a metal strip as well. This allows you to use the holes in any given row to connect components together. To see which holes are connected to which, take a multimeter and a couple of wires, set the multimeter to measure continuity, stick the two wires in two holes, and measure them with the multimeter. If the meter indicates continuity, then the two holes in question are connected.</p>

<p>The image below (Figure 11) of the back of a breadboard may help to clear up how the holes on the front of the board are connected. The backing of the board has been removed (don’t remove the backing on your own board! It will make the board useless) to expose the metal strips connecting the holes. You can clearly see the short horizontal strips in the center separated by the divider, and the long strips vertically down the side. The detailed photo in Figure 12&nbsp; illustrates how the holes and strips are related. Each of the holes connected to the horizontal strips are connected, and each of the holes connected to each long vertical side strips are connected to each other. </p>

<p>The reason for the center divider is so that you&nbsp;can mount integrated circuit chips, like a microprocessor, on the breadboard. IC chips in a <strong>DIP package</strong> (Dual In-line Package) have two rows of pins that to which you need to connect other components. The center row isolates the two rows from each other, and gives you several holes connected to each pin, so that you can connect other components.</p>



<h2><span id="Powering_the_Breadboard">Powering the Breadboard</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Avoid adding, removing, or changing components on a breadboard whenever the board is powered. You risk shocking yourself and damaging your components.</span></p>



<p>The most common connections you need on a breadboard are voltage and ground. That&#8217;s why solderless breadboards are designed the way they are. The long rows of connected holes down either side are designed to be used as  power and ground <strong>buses</strong>. A <strong>bus</strong> is a long electrical connection that has many points where you can connect to it. Figure 13 shows the typical wiring on a breadboard, connecting the bus rows on the left with those on the right. </p>

<p>Next you&#8217;ll see how to connect an Arduino microcontroller to your breadboard to supply power to the components on the board. Later on, you&#8217;ll see how to power a board without a microcontroller. </p>



<h2><span id="Using_a_Breadboard_with_a_Microcontroller">Using a Breadboard with a Microcontroller</span></h2>



<p>For most projects in this class you&#8217;ll power your circuit via a microcontroller like the Arduino Nano 33 IoT or the Uno.  To do that, your breadboard will usually be connected as shown in Figures 14 and 15.  You&#8217;ll connect the voltage and ground buses on the breadboard to voltage and ground from the microcontroller. On the Arduino module, you can  use the 5V or 3.3V output, depending on the circuit you are using and  depending on your model. Typically, you&#8217;ll use 5V on the Uno and 3.3V on the Nano 33 IoT. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/wp-content/uploads/LabTemplate_bb.png"><img loading="lazy" width="559" height="365" src="https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/wp-content/uploads/LabTemplate_bb.png" alt="An Arduino Uno on the left connected to a solderless breadboard, right.

The red and blue columns on the left of the breadboard are connected to the red and blue columns on the right side of the breadboard with red and black wires, respectively. These columns on the side of a breadboard are commonly called the buses. The red line is the voltage bus, and the black or blue line is the ground bus.

<p><a name="LabTemplate_bb"></a>As shown in Figure 15, the Uno&#8217;s 5V output hole is connected to the red side column of holes on the far left side of the breadboard; this is the <strong>voltage bus</strong>. The Uno&#8217;s ground hole is connected to the blue side column on the left of the board, or <strong>ground bus</strong>. The red and blue columns on the left of the breadboard are connected to the red and blue columns on the right side of the breadboard with red and black wires, respectively.  With this setup, you can supply 5V to any component on the breadboard, using the Uno&#8217;s onboard 5-volt regulator. You can power the Uno either through USB or through a 9-12V power supply plugged into the Uno&#8217;s power jack.  <meta charset="utf-8">There is a limit to the current that you can supply from this regulator, though, about 1 amp at 5V.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">If you&#8217;re using an Uno for this lab, connecting the circuit in Figure 14, then set your multimeter to measure DC voltage, and measure the voltage between the voltage and ground buses of your breadboard.

<p><a name="LabTemplateNanoShort_bb"></a>In Figure 15, you see a similar setup for the Arduino Nano 33 IoT.  The Nano is mounted at the top of the breadboard, straddling the center divide, with its USB connector facing up. The top pins of the Nano are in row 1 of the breadboard.</p>



<p>The Nano, like all Dual-Inline Package (DIP) modules, has its physical pins numbered in a U shape, from top left to bottom left, to bottom right to top right. The Nano&#8217;s 3.3V out pin (physical pin 2) is connected to the left side red column of the breadboard. This is the <strong>voltage bus</strong>. The Nano&#8217;s GND pin (physical pin 14) is connected to the left side black column, the <strong>ground bus</strong>.  The blue columns (ground buses) are connected together at the bottom of the breadboard with a black wire. The red columns (voltage buses) are connected together at the bottom of the breadboard with a red wire. Wired like this, you can supply 3.3V to any component on the breadboard through the Nano&#8217;s onboard 3.3V regulator. There is a limit to the current that you can supply from this regulator, though, about 1 amp at 3.3V.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re using a Nano for this lab, connecting the circuit in Figure 15, then set your multimeter to measure DC voltage, and measure the voltage between pin 2 of the Nano (3.3V out) and pin 14 (ground). When the Nano is plugged into a USB power supply, you should get 3.3V. </p>



<h2><span id="Powering_A_Breadboard_Circuit_From_A_Microcontroller_Via_A_DC_Power_Supply">Powering A Breadboard Circuit From A Microcontroller Via A DC Power Supply</span></h2>



<p>Quite often, you&#8217;ll want to supply power to a circuit through an Arduino. Sometimes, you&#8217;ll have components that run at the microcontroller&#8217;s voltage, and sometimes they will require a higher voltage. From both the Nano and the Uno, if you power them from a DC power supply, you can supply 5V, 3.3V and the voltage of the power supply.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re not powering it via its USB connector, the Nano 33 IoT and the Nano Every can be powered through the V<sub>in</sub> pin (pin 15, bottom left side of the module) by a voltage range from 7 &#8211; 21 volts. This wide range means that you can use a 9V battery, or a DC power supply anywhere from 7-21V. When you power the Nano this way, you get 3.3V from the 3V3 pin (pin 2) just as if you were powering from USB. If you have components that need a higher voltage, you can supply them directly from your power supply via the V<sub>in</sub> pin. Figure 16 shows a Nano powered from a 12V DC power jack. The Jack&#8217;s positive terminal is connected to the V<sub>in</sub> pin (pin 15) and the negative terminal is connected to the ground pin (pin 14). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="464" src="https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/wp-content/uploads/NanoExternalPower_bb-1.png" alt=" Breadboard view of a Nano 33 IoT on a breadboard connected to a DC power jack for external DC powering." class="wp-image-8991"/><figcaption><em>Figure 16. Breadboard view of a Nano 33 IoT on a breadboard connected to a DC power jack for external DC powering. The jack&#8217;s positive terminal is connected to the Nano&#8217;s Vin pin (pin 15) and the negative terminal is connected to ground (pin 14). In this configuration, the Nano will run, and will output 3.3V between the 3V3 pin (pin 2) and ground. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you are using a DC power supply as shown in Figure 16, you can also add a 5V regulator powered by the power supply, if you need both 3.3V and 5V for your components. Figure 17 shows a Nano supplied by a DC power jack on the V<sub>in</sub> and ground pins, and a 5V regulator attached to the V<sub>in</sub> pin as well, to supply 5V for components that need that voltage. </p>



<p>Try connecting the circuit in Figure 17, then set your multimeter to measure DC voltage, and measure the voltage between pin 2 of the Nano (3.3V out) and pin 14 (ground). When the DC power jack is plugged in, you should get 3.3V. Now move the positive (red) probe of your meter to the bottom pin of the voltage regulator (row 21 on the board). You should read 5V. Now move the positive probe to the Nano&#8217;s pin 16 (V<sub>in</sub>). You should read whatever the voltage of the DC power supply is, somewhere between 7 and 21V. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="514" src="https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/wp-content/uploads/NanoExternalPower_7805_bb.png" alt="Breadboard view of a Nano 33 IoT and a 7805 voltage regulator powered from a DC power jack." class="wp-image-8992"/><figcaption><em>Figure 17.

The DC power jack is wired as shown in the previous figure (positive terminal to V<sub>in</sub>, negative terminal to ground. However, in this image, a 5V regulator is added on the breadboard below the Nano. Its V<sub>in</sub> pin is connected to the V<sub>in</sub> of the Nano (and the DC power supply&#8217;s positive terminal) and its ground is connected to the ground bus. In this circuit, you can supply 3.3V via the Nano&#8217;s 3V3 pin (pin 2), 5V from the 7805 regulator, and 7-21V from the DC power supply.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Uno accepts 7-12V in via its DC power jack, and it has two voltage regulators on board. Pin 5 on the left side of the board supplies 5V, and pin 4 on the left side supplies 3.3V. Pin 8 on the left side is connected directly to the V<sub>in</sub>, so you can supply 7-12V, depending on the voltage of your DC power supply, from that pin. For example, figure 18 shows an Uno connected to a 9V battery and supplying 9V to the breadboard via the V<sub>in</sub> pin.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="558" src="https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/wp-content/uploads/UnoExternalPower_bb.png" alt="Uno connected to a 9V battery via a battery clip.

The Uno is thus supplying 9V for any components on that breadboard.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">If you&#8217;re using an Uno for this lab, connecting the circuit in Figure 18, then set your multimeter to measure DC voltage, and measure the voltage between the voltage and ground buses of your breadboard. When the Uno is plugged into a DC power supply, you should get whatever the voltage of the DC power supply is, between 7 and 12V. </p>



<p>With an external power supply and a voltage regulator, you can supply almost any voltage your components might need, while still giving the Arduino the voltage it needs to run. In general, you will always connect the ground lines together, and keep the different voltages separate from each other. To see an application of this, see the <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/" data-type="page" data-id="405">Using a Transistor to Control High Current Loads with an Arduino Lab</a>.</p>



<p>You can use the circuits above as templates for almost any microcontroller-driven project. Even if you&#8217;re just using the microcontroller to power the breadboard, as shown below, you can still work with these circuits as a base. </p>

<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll want to build circuits without a microcontroller. This section shows you how to set up a breadboard without a microcontroller. You&#8217;ll add a 5-volt voltage regulator, and power the board from a 12-volt DC power adapter which feeds the regulator.  </p>



<p>The regulator in Figure 19 is used to supply 5 Volts to the red side columns of the breadboard. In this image, you&#8217;re looking at the board sideways, with the the back of the regulator facing you.  The pins of the regulator are, from left to right: voltage out, ground, voltage in. Notice that the regulator&#8217;s voltage out pin on the left is connected to the red side row of the breadboard with a red wire. The regulator&#8217;s center pin (ground) is connected to the black side row. These will be your voltage and ground <strong>bus rows</strong>. The side  rows on one side are connected to the corresponding side rows on the other side via two wires. The two black rows are connected to each other via a black wire, and the red rows are connected via a red wire. </p>

<p>With your board connected like this, you&#8217;ll be able to build many different 5-Volt circuits on the board. The last thing you need to add is a power connector to connect 9 &#8211; 12 volts DC to supply power for the voltage regulator. Figure 20 below shows a power connector connected to the voltage input and ground pins of the voltage regulator. This circuit is now the same as the one shown in Figure 17 above, but with the Arduino Nano removed.</p>

<p>If you connected an LED and resistor just as it&#8217;s shown in Figures 29 and 30, and it didn&#8217;t light, check to make sure that the anode (the long leg) of the LED is connected to the resistor, and the cathode (the short leg) is connected to the ground wire.<br></div>

<p>Below,  in Figure 31, the three LED’s are connected in parallel using two rows. They are then connected to power and ground by connecting the rows to the voltage row and the ground row. These three LEDs are in parallel with each other.</p>

<p>Many options are possible using a breadboard, which is what makes them very useful and convenient for building circuits. Once you understand which holes are connected to each other (and which ones are not), you can build any circuit very quickly.</p>



<h2><span id="Breadboarding_Best_Practices">Breadboarding Best Practices</span></h2>



<p>It’s a good idea to keep your circuits neat. When possible, shorten the leads on components so there is no bare metal sticking up from the breadboard. Make sure no wires cross each other with metal touching (this is the biggest source of short circuits on a breadboard). Lay things out as sensibly as possible, so each component of the circuit is near the components it needs to connect to. Use wires when needed to separate parts of the circuit that are crowded together. Use consistent colors of wires when possible; for example, use green or black for ground connections, red for power connections, white or blue for data connections, and so forth. This will make your troubleshooting much easier.</p>
