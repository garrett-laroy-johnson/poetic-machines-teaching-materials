            This lab will introduce you to a few basic electronic principles by
            trying them in action. You&#8217;ll learn how to measure voltage,
            amperage, and resistance using a multimeter. You will also learn
            about components in series vs. parallel and be introduced to
            Ohm&#8217;s Law in practice. For more information on the theory
            behind this lab, please

          <p>
            When you&#8217;re building electronics, you run into problems all
            the time. Diagnosing those problems relies not only on a good
            theoretical knowledge of how circuits work, but also on practical
            knowledge of how to test them. The most common tool for testing
            circuits is the&nbsp;multimeter, a device that can measure current,
            voltage, resistance, and electrical continuity. More expensive
            multimeters can also measure other electrical properties, but if you
            can measure these four, you can diagnose most common circuit
            problems.

            Before you get started, you will want to make sure your meter is
            working. This is a particularly good idea if you&#8217;re using a
            meter that lots of other people use, such as the ones at ITP. Here
            is how to test that:
          </p>

          <p>
            Insert the two probes. Insert the Black probe in the “COM” jack.
            This is the COMmon, or ground, connection. The Red probe should be
            in the “V” jack (Figure 11). This connection is for measuring
            voltage. It can also be used to measure resistance in Ohms, or
            frequency in megaHertz, on the meter shown here.

            Turn the function knob to the Diode/Continuity Function and switch
            the meter on. If the word “Hold” appears on the screen, press the
            hold button once to disable the hold function (not all meters have a
            clearly labeled Hold function; check your meter&#8217;s manual to be
            sure – see Figure 12). This function is used to hold a value
            onscreen after you remove the probes from a circuit. The “1.” on
            left picture means the value is out of range now.

            Touch the tips of the probes together. The meter will beep and the
            display value should be less than 0.01 (Figure 13). If it works,
            congratulations! you have a usable meter. If not, try to push the
            plug of the probes to improve the contacts (Figure 14). In many
            cases the failure is caused by loose contact of the jacks. In other
            cases, you might have a weak or dead battery.

          <h2>
            <span id="The_Controls_on_a_Meter">The Controls on a Meter</span>
          </h2>

          <p>
            Different meters have different controls, but most meters will have
            the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Voltage</strong>: This setting is generally broken up into
              Volts DC, indicating that the polarity of the voltage will not
              change, and Volts AC, indicating that the polarity will alternate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Amperage</strong>: This setting measures the current in a
              circuit. Again, it&#8217;s usually broken up into AC and DC. There
              are commonly two holes for the positive probe to measure current,
              one that&#8217;s low amperage and the other that&#8217;s high
              amperage. Don&#8217;t try to measure high amperages with the
              positive probe in the low amperage hole or you will damage the
              meter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resistance</strong>: Resistance is measured in ohms. This
              function is sometimes grouped with the continuity check.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Continuity</strong>: Continuity measures for a connection,
              generally very low or no resistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diode Check</strong>:&nbsp;Diode check measures for a
              voltage drop across a diode, typically 2.7V or less. If you hold
              the positive probe on the anode of the diode and the common probe
              on the cathode, you&#8217;ll see a voltage drop. If you reverse
              the probes, you&#8217;ll see no reading.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Some meters are <strong>auto-ranging</strong>, meaning that they
            will choose the right order of magnitude for a reading
            automatically. These meters will only have one setting for a given
            property (volts, ohms, amps, etc). Other meters are not
            auto-ranging. These meters will have multiple settings for a given
            property. For example, the meter in the next section below has
            multiple settings for the resistance (or ohms) property: 2M
            (megohms), 200k (kilohms), 20k, 2k, and 200 ohms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many meters will have additional functions, like temperature,
            capacitance, transistor checks, and more. The functions listed above
            are the minimum that you can expect, however.
          </p>

          <p>
            Figures 15 and 16 show two multimeters. Figure 16 is autoranging and
            Figure 15 is not. Notice how the autoranging meter has only one
            setting per function, while the non-autoranging meter has several
            per function. For example, Voltage on the meter in Figure 15 is
            divided into AC (marked by a ~) and DC (marked by a ⎓). Within&nbsp;
            those two areas, there are multiple possible ranges: DC voltage can
            be set to 200mV, 2V, 20V, 200V, or 6ooV. Each range setting
            represents the maximum voltage you can read on that setting.
          </p>

            You can use the continuity check to find connections on a switch or

            also use it to measure whether there&#8217;s a break in a wire, or
            whether a given material conducts electricity. Set your meter as
            shown here, and try touching the probes together. The meter should
            beep.

            If you touch two points on a switch, what happens when you switch

            continuous conductor. It can conduct small amounts of current
            though. You don&#8217;t want your body to carry high amounts of
            current or voltage though, because it can damage or kill you.

            <strong>Resistance</strong> is a material property of any component,
            like a resistor or a wire. To measure the resistance of a component,
            you have to remove the component from the circuit. To measure
            resistance, turn your meter to the setting marked with the Greek
            letter Omega (Ω), as shown in Figure 21.

          <p>
            If your meter is not an auto-ranging meter, you want the meter set
            to the approximate range, and slightly higher than, of the
            component&#8217;s resistance. For example, to measure a 10-Kilohm
            resistance, you&#8217;d choose 20K, because 10K and 20K are in the
            same order of magnitude. For a 50K resistance, or anything over 20K,
            you&#8217;d have to step up to 200K. If you don&#8217;t know the
            component&#8217;s resistance, start with the meter set to a high
            reading, like 2M (2 Megohms). If you get a reading of zero, turn the
            meter one step lower, and keep doing so until you get a good
            reading. A reading of 1 on the left side of the meter, or of 0L,
            indicates you&#8217;re set to too low a range.

            Not all components will register resistance. For example, a wire
            will ideally register 0 Ohms, because you want wires to have as
            little resistance as possible so they don&#8217;t affect the
            circuit. The longer the wire, the greater the resistance, however.
            Likewise, switches have ideally zero resistance.

          <p>
            The circuit shown in Figure 22 is not complete. The resistor
            connecting the LED to voltage has been removed to measure its
            resistance. The resistor would normally connect in the row
            connecting to the red wire (row 12) to the anode of the LED (row
            15).&nbsp;<strong

          <h3><span id="Resistance_and_Diodes">Resistance and Diodes</span></h3>

          <p>
            If you measure the resistance of a <strong>diode</strong> (such as
            the LED shown in Figure 20), you may see a number flash briefly on
            the meter, then disappear. This is because diodes ideally have
            little or no resistance once voltage is flowing through them, but
            have what&#8217;s called a <strong>forward bias,</strong
            ><em>&nbsp;</em>which is a minimum voltage needed to get current
            flowing. Before you reach the forward bias voltage, the
            diode&#8217;s resistance is ideally infinite. After you reach it,
            the resistance is ideally zero. There are no ideals in electronics,
            however, which is why you see a resistance value flash briefly as
            the meter meets the diode&#8217;s forward bias. Most meters have a
            diode check setting, marked with a diode symbol, that will allow you
            to check the forward bias of the diode.

          <p>
            Try measuring the resistance across your hand. Set the meter really
            high, perhaps 20 Megohms. Do you get anything? You should get a
            resistance in the 2-20 Megohm range. Make your palm sweaty, or lick
            it, and try again. You should get a lower resistance, perhaps 0.2
            Megohms or so.

            Once a circuit is complete and powered, you should learn to read
            voltages between different points in the circuit. Wire a 7805 5-Volt
            voltage regulator on a breadboard as shown above and connect it to
            power. If you don&#8217;t have one, you can use the 5V or 3.3V
            output from an Arduino instead, as explained above. Now add an LED
            and a 220-ohm resistor to the breadboard as shown in Figure 23.

            Note how the long leg, or <strong>anode</strong>, of the LED goes to
            voltage through the resistor, and the short leg, or

            measure voltage in this circuit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Voltage</strong> is a measure of the difference in
            electrical potential energy between two points in a circuit.
            It&#8217;s always measured between two points in a circuit.
            Measuring the voltage between the two sides of a component like an
            LED tells you how much voltage that component uses. &nbsp;When
            you&#8217;re measuring voltage between one side of a component and
            another, for example, it&#8217;s called measuring the voltage drop
            &#8220;across&#8221; the component.
          </p>

          <p>
            Set your multimeter to measure DC volts (Figure 24). The voltage
            regulator you&#8217;re using can take an input voltage range of
            about 8 to 15 volts, and it outputs 5 volts, so you know that no
            voltage you&#8217;ll read in this circuit is over 15 volts. If your
            meter has a variety of ranges for DC volts, choose a range that
            &#8216;s closest to, and greater than, 15 volts. For example, many
            meters have a setting for 20 volts, meaning that they can read up to
            20V DC at that setting.

            Did you get a negative voltage? Why would that happen? That means
            you placed the red probe on the point of lower voltage, and the
            black probe on the point of higher voltage. In other words, you
            <strong>reversed the polarity</strong>.

            Connect the board to your power supply and press the switch. It will
            illuminate the LED. Let go of the switch and it will turn the LED
            off again. By pressing the switch you are completing a circuit and
            allowing the resistor and LED to begin consuming electricity. The
            resistor is very important in this circuit as it protects the LED
            from being over-powered, which will eventually burn it out. A
            typical LED operates at a voltage of 2.0-2.6 volts (V) and consumes
            approximately 20 milliamps (mA). The resistor limits the current to
            a level that is safe for the LED. The higher the resistor value, the
            less voltage that will reach the LED. The lower the resistor value
            (with 0 ohms being no resistor at all), the more&nbsp; the voltage
            that will reach the LED.

          <p>
            Now, while playing with the pushbutton, measure the voltage across
            the pushbutton as you did in the last step, both in the on position
            and the off position. Is there a voltage drop across the
            pushbutton?&nbsp;What voltage do you read when the pushbutton is not
            pressed?
          </p>

          <p>
            Measure the voltage across the LED and the resistor as well. Does
            the total voltage across all the components add up to the voltage
            between voltage and ground on your board? Remember, in any circuit,
            all of the voltage must be used up. Why? If the voltage across all
            the components doesn&#8217;t add up, that indicates to you that some
            of the electrical energy is getting converted to light, heat, and
            other forms of energy. No component is 100% efficient, so
            there&#8217;s always the possibility for some loss.

            2V to reach its forward bias and turn on. If you have three in

            Measure the voltage across each LED. It should be the same across

            Now you&#8217;re going to read the amperage at various points in the
            circuit. Move your meter&#8217;s red probe to the hole for measuring
            high amperage. On many meters, there are three holes, one
            marked&nbsp; &#8220;Volts/Ohms/mA&#8221;,&nbsp; and another marked
            &#8220;10A&#8221;. The right one can be used for measuring amperage
            when the expected amperage is less than 1A. The left is for
            measuring high amperage, up to 10A (Figure 35). If you&#8217;re not
            sure, it&#8217;s best to use the hole for 10A. Then set your meter
            to measure DC amperage.

            To measure the amperage through a given component, you need to place
            your meter <strong>in series</strong> with the component. When two
            components are in series, the amperage flowing through both of them
            is the same. For this, use the circuit with the three parallel LEDs
            that&#8217;s shown in Figures 36 and 37. To measure the amperage
            through any one of the LEDs in this circuit, you&#8217;ll need to
            disconnect one of the LED&#8217;s ends from the circuit (<strong
              >disconnect power first!</strong

            You&#8217;ll find that the amperage drawn by the LEDs is tiny, on
            the order of 10 or 20 milliamps at the most. That&#8217;s normal for
            LEDs. Make sure that you check which holes your meter probes are
            connected to when you&#8217;re using a meter.

            <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Warning:</strong></span
            >&nbsp;Measuring amperage with the red probe in the voltage hole
            when you have no idea how big the current is, or measuring voltage
            with it in the amperage holes is a good way to damage the meter.

          <p>
            In this last step, you&#8217;ll generate a changing voltage using a
            potentiometer. A potentiometer is a resistor that can change its
            resistance. A potentiometer (or pot) has three connections. The
            outer connections are the ends of a fixed value resistor. The center
            connection connects to a wiper which slides along the fixed
            resistor. The resistance between the center connection and either of
            the outside connection changes as the pot&#8217;s knob is moved.

          <p>
            If your potentiometer does not have pins that will insert into a
            breadboard, then solder hook-up wires to the pot connections as
            shown in Figures 38 and 39.

          <p>
            As you turn the potentiometer from one end to the other, measure the
            voltage between the center position and ground. The pot is acting as
            a <strong>voltage divider</strong>, dividing the 5V into two parts.
            As the voltage feeding the LED goes up or down, the LED gets
            brighter or dimmer. The 220-ohm resistor in the circuit protects the
            LED from over-voltage when the resistance between the pot&#8217;s
            voltage lead and its center lead is 0 ohms.
