    <p>
      In this lab you will learn about different types of switches and their
      terminology. You&#8217;ll use switches and pushbuttons frequently in
      physical computing projects, as shown in Figure 1, and it&#8217;s helpful
      to be aware of the terminology used in describing them when shopping for
      them or trying to understand tutorials that use them.

    <p>
      As shown in Figure 2, there are two common types of digital inputs:
      <strong>switches</strong> and pushbuttons. A switch is a mechanism that
      brings two pieces of metal together using some form of lever action. Think
      of everyday household light switches. &nbsp;A
      <strong>pushbutton</strong> brings two pieces of metal together when you
      push down on it. Think of elevator buttons.

            alt="Drawing of a switch, left, and a pushbutton, right. The switch has two lines separated by a gap, with a hinged third line almost connecting them, indicating that it is the switch between the two contacts. The pushbutton has two lines separated by a gap and a third line parallel to them, indicating that, it would close the connection between the first two lines when pressed against them."

    <p>
      Switches and pushbuttons can be <strong>normally open,</strong> meaning
      that when the switch is in its normal position (not being touched by a
      person) the contacts are not touching.&nbsp;<strong
        >Normally closed</strong
      >&nbsp;means that when the switch or pushbutton is in its normal position,
      the contacts are touching, or closed.
    </p>

    <p>
      As shown in Figure 3, a single switch can control more than one set of
      contacts. A <strong>Single&nbsp;throw</strong>&nbsp;switch has&nbsp;only
      two contacts. The switch is open or
      closed.&nbsp;<strong>Dual&nbsp;Throw</strong>&nbsp;switches
      have&nbsp;three contacts, and switching the switch moves a&nbsp;center
      contact from&nbsp;one outer contact to &nbsp;the other outer contact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Switches can have multiple poles as well. A&nbsp;<strong
        >Single pole</strong
      >&nbsp;switch&nbsp;has&nbsp;only one set of contacts that it&nbsp;closes
      or opens when it moves. <strong>Dual Pole</strong> switches, as shown in
      Figure 4,&nbsp; have two sets of contacts being controlled by the same
      mechanism. With a dual pole switch, you can switch two separate circuits
      with the same mechanism. In a dual pole switch, the mechanism connecting
      the contacts is an insulator, so that the poles don&#8217;t connect. The
      knife switch in the image below is a
      <strong>dual pole, dual throw</strong> switch.

      <strong>Pushbuttons</strong>(Figure 5) or
      <strong>momentary switches</strong>&nbsp;stay closed only as long as you
      hold them closed.&nbsp;<strong>Roller switches</strong>(Figure 6) are
      pushbuttons with a lever and a roller attached. They&#8217;re useful when
      you need something to push against the switch gently to close it.

      <strong>Tactile Switches</strong> are pushbuttons that have a tactile
      click to them (Figure 7). They are usually designed to be soldered to a
      circuit board, and they fit into a breadboard nicely as well. They are
      perhaps the most common switches you&#8217;ll use in physical computing.
      You can get them in a variety of colors and sizes.&nbsp; They generally
      have four pins, arranged in a rectangle. If you hold the switch so that
      the wide side of the rectangle of pins is horizontal, then the top two
      pins are generally connected to each other, and the bottom two are
      connected to each other. The switch is between the two wide sides. The
      schematic in Figure 8 shows how they are wired.

      <strong>Arcade buttons</strong> (Figure 9) are popular game consoles
      because they are big and robust. They often have a built-in LED that you
      can control independently of the switch. In this way they are similar to
      other illuminated switches and pushbuttons.

      <strong>Magnetic switches</strong> (Figure 12) have two metal leaves in
      the end that are pulled together when a magnet is brought close to them.
      They&#8217;re useful when you can&#8217;t have wires on both sides of the
      switch mechanism. <strong>Magnetic snaps </strong>(Figure 13)&nbsp;are
      useful when you&#8217;re making a soft circuit and need a fastener on the
      garment to close a switch.

      <strong>Whisker switches</strong> (Figure 14) are made from a piece of
      spring steel or piano wire, and a center post. An insulator such as a
      piece of electrical tape or shrink-wrap holds the two separate. When the
      wire is touched, the spring bends and touches the metal post, and closes
      the switch.

    <p>
      <strong>Tilt switches</strong> (Figure 15) contain a metal ball and two
      wires at one end. Some tilt switches have one wire contact at each end
      instead. When you tilt the switch, the ball touches both contacts, and
      closes the switch. There are also
      <strong>mercury switches</strong>&nbsp;that do the same, but with a ball
      of mercury inside. Avoid these, since mercury is very poisonous.

      All you need to do is arrange the two conductors in such a way that they
      can touch or not touch. Sometimes a spacer layered between the two
      conductors helps. For example, in figure 19 you see three pieces of
      conductive material. Two of the pieces have non-conductive layers on top
      of them. When the non-conductive part is sandwiched between the conductive
      layers, you&#8217;ve got a switch that&#8217;s pressed by touching. The
      conductive parts touch when they&#8217;re pressed through the holes in the
      non-conductive part. These two switches would have different sensitivities
      because the hole-to-material ratio of the non-conductive layer is
      different.

      Make your own switch. Find a way to turn a closing door into a switch, for
      example, or to close a switch when a person sits down. Or figure out how
      to turn a hat into a switch, or a cane, or a zipper. Or perhaps the pieces
      of a puzzle can be switches. Come up with an everyday activity to which
      you can add three or four custom switches that, when combined, turn on a
      light. For example, maybe the light comes on when you close the door, sit
      down, and open a book. Or when you walk upstairs, put your keys on a side
      table, and remove your hat. Combine your creativity with switches with
      what you learned in the&nbsp;<a

      Through a combination of series and parallel switches, you can come up
      with a variety of combinations that make the light turn on. Depending on
      where you add the LEDs, you can even have the same switches turn on
      different LEDs in different combinations. Try a few combinations and see
      what happens.

    <p>
      In a simple circuit, a DC motor* is no different than an LED as a load.
      You can switch it as well, as shown in Figure 24-25. Make sure your power
      supply can supply the current and amperage that your motor requires and
      you are good to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      * DC Motor converts direct current (DC) electrical energy into mechanical
      energy.

Red and black wires from the jack connect to a 7805 5-volt voltage regulator mounted in the top right three rows of the breadboard with its tab facing to the right. The power supply's red wire is connected to the regulator's top pin row, the input pin. The power supply's black wire is connected to the regulator's middle pin, or ground.

Similarly, a black wire connects the left side ground bus to the outer row on the right side. This is the right side ground bus. A red wire connects the the left side voltage bus to row 13 in the left center section of the board. A pushbutton is mounted across the center divide of the breadboard with its pins in rows 13 and 15. A DC motor is connected to row 15 in the left center section of the board.

      With a dual pole switch, you could control both a DC motor&nbsp;<em
        >and</em
      >
      an LED. The small square pushbuttons that come with many kits for Arduino
      are dual pole switches. The left side of the switch and the right side of
      the switch can switch different loads, like shown in Figure 26-27:
