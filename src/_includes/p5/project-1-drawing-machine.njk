sketch:
  title: "Project 1: Generative Drawing Machine"
  requirements:
    - use at least one for loop. Some A-level projects may use only one, but it's very likely you will need to us a nested for loop or more.
    - use at least global 4 variables that can be changed to influence the outcome of your generative drawing machine  
    - use randomSeed() or noiseSeed() and select one final version of your compositions
    - you are present for critique and participate in others' critique
  text:
    - Using p5*js, create a drawing machine. Think of this as a compositional system -- be able to change variables to change the kind of outputs you get. You can visualize whatever you want, but try not to simply copy and paste code from various sketchesâ€¦ understanding what the code is doing is super important!
