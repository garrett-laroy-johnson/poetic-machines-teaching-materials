  title: "Coding Sketch: Functions"
  text:
    - Create a p5 sketch in which you compose *your own* function.
  requirements:
    - contain drawing commands for a 2D complex form (a visual figure comprised of 2 or more 2D primitives, such as the robots or the owls in the text). It could be a tree or bush, a spaceship, two intertwined funky squiggles, a skyscraper
    - Select *at least two aspects* of that drawing to modify with the random() function. These aspects should passed to the function as parameters. Call this function more than 4 times in order to create a group effect (a tree becomes a forest, a skyscraper becomes a skyline, a spaceship becomes a fleet of nice, friendly aliens coming to a picnic).
    - BONUS. Use a for loop to call your function many (!) times.
